            Hi there! My name is Anna Olt. Short and sweet, unlike me who is
            tall and fiesty. I am recent graduate of thhe Full-Stack Coding
            bootcamp at UCLA. I also have a full-time job, which has led me to
            this field. I work for my family business, which is called McRoberts
            Technologies. We provide risk-specific solutions for security
            purposes. Before last year it was called "McRoberts Protective
            Agency," and is the oldest security company in America! Started by
            my great, great, great grandfather in 1876. One hundred and
            Fourty-Four years later we are still in the security business, but
            have now moved on to technology. When I was first introduced to the
            software I had so many questions about aesthetics and functionality.
            So, I decided I would like to make the software changes on my own by
            and help my family's company while learning valuable skills that may
            eventually lead to a new career.
